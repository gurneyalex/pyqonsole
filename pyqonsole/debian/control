Description: X Window terminal emulation written in Python
 The code is based on konsole, and it uses the qt toolkit. It is
 mainly meant for use by Python application developpers who would like
 to embed a terminal in their application, but it can be used as a not
 blazingly fast XTerm replacement, consuming a lot more memory than
 rxvt or xterm.
