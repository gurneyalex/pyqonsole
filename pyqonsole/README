pyqonsole
=========

Pyqonsole is a X Window terminal written in Python. The code is based
on konsole, and it uses the qt toolkit. It is mainly meant for use by
Python application developpers who would like to embed a terminal in
their application, but it can be used as a not blazingly fast XTerm
replacement.

The development was initially funded by CEA Grenoble, and the project
is released under the CeCILL_ license.
