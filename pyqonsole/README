pyqonsole
=========

Pyqonsole_ is a X Window terminal written in Python. The code is based
on konsole_, and it uses the PyQt_ graphical library. It is mainly
meant for use by Python application developpers who would like to
embed a terminal in their application, but it can be used as a not
blazingly fast XTerm replacement.

The development was initially funded by CEA Grenoble, and the project
is released under the CeCILL_ license. Many thanks to konsole's
maintainer Lars Doelle for helping us during the porting effort.
