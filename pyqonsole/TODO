TODO list for pyqonsole
-----------------------

* finish testing emuVt102: 
  * mouse + keyboard handling (onMouse, onKeyPress, scrollLock)
  * cleanup doc / test to see what's / what's not implemented from
    codes.txt 

* procctrl, process:
  * processcontroller singleton implementation
  * bad interaction between processcontroller and processes
    (C++ destructor vs python __del__)

* backport modules: 
  * TESession
  * TEScreen
  * TEWidget

* see kxb part of emuVt102 ?

* refactor to be more pythonic
